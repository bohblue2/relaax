# <type>: Short summarize of main changes <subject>
# |<----  Using a Maximum Of 50 Characters  ---->|

# More detailed explanatory text, if necessary. Wrap it to about 72
# characters or so. In some contexts, the first line is treated as the
# subject of the commit and the rest of the text as the body. The
# blank line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless
# you omit the body entirely); various tools like `log`, `shortlog`
# and `rebase` can get confused if you run the two together.
# |<----   Try To Limit Each Line to a Maximum Of 72 Characters   ---->|

# Explain the problem that this commit is solving. Focus on why you
# are making this change as opposed to how (the code explains that).
# Are there side effects or other unintuitive consequenses of this
# change? Here's the place to explain them.

# Further paragraphs come after blank lines.

# - Bullet points are okay, too

# - Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, preceded
#   by a single space, with blank lines in between, but conventions
#   vary here

# Provide links or keys to any relevant tickets, articles or other resources.
# If you use an issue tracker, put references to them at the bottom, like this:
# Resolves: #123
# See also: #456, #789


# --- COMMIT END ---
# Type can be 
#    feat (new feature)
#    fix (bug fix)
#    docs (changes to documentation)
#    style (formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no code change)
#    refactor (refactoring production code)
#    test (adding missing tests, refactoring tests; no production code change)
#    chore (updating grunt tasks etc; no production code change)
# --- Additional code specific types ---
#    init (add some skeleton to continue to work on)
#    cfg (use to set and update some configurations; no code change)
#    fit (similar to refactor, but use only to fit current version of code)
#    add (add some auxiliary code which can't represent as feature)
#    upd (similar to add, but use as intermediate steps between add and feat)
# --------------------
# Remember to
#    Separate subject from body with a blank line
#    Limit the subject line to 50 characters
#    Capitalize the subject line
#    Do not end the subject line with a period
#    Use the imperative mood in the subject line
#    Wrap the body at 72 characters
#    Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
#    Can use multiple lines with "-" for bullet points in body
